# 📦 Devs Commands

Bot management and diagnostic commands restricted to the bot owner and trusted developers. These commands are not surfaced to regular users.
### Diagnostic Commands (Owner or Dev):
- `/stats`: Display bot statistics and system info.
- `/chatinfo <chat_id>`: Display detailed information about a chat (requires numeric chat ID argument).
- `/chatlist`: Generate and send a list of all active chats.
- `/leavechat <chat_id>`: Force the bot to leave a specified chat.
### Team Commands:
- `/teamusers`: List all team members (includes owner, devs, sudo users).
### Owner Commands:
- `/addsudo`: Grant sudo permissions to a user.
- `/adddev`: Grant developer permissions to a user.
- `/remsudo`: Revoke sudo permissions from a user.
- `/remdev`: Revoke developer permissions from a user.

**Team Hierarchy:**
The Devs module provides bot management and diagnostic commands restricted to the bot's internal team. The team has three tiers with descending privilege levels.

**Tier 1 — Owner:** Set via `OWNER_ID` environment variable at deployment. Full control: manage team roster, all diagnostic commands, all team commands.

**Tier 2 — Dev:** Assigned by owner via `/adddev`. Has diagnostic command access: `/stats`, `/chatinfo`, `/chatlist`, `/leavechat`. Also listed in `/teamusers`.

**Tier 2 — Sudo:** Assigned by owner via `/addsudo`. Listed in `/teamusers` but does NOT have diagnostic command access.

**Tier 3 — Team Member:** Automatically includes owner + all sudo + all dev users. View team roster only via `/teamusers`.

**Note:** Sudo users only appear in `/teamusers`. `/stats`, `/chatinfo`, `/chatlist`, and `/leavechat` require Dev or Owner.

**Important:** These commands are not visible in the public help menu and silently ignore unauthorized users.
