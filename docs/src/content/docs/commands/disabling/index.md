# ❌ Disabling Commands

This module allows you to disable some commonly used commands, So, no one can use them. It'll also allow you to autodelete them, stopping people from blue texting.

*Admin commands*:
× /disable `<commandname>`: Stop users from using commandname in this group.
× /enable `<item name>`: Allow users from using commandname in this group.
× /disableable: List all disableable commands.
× /disabledel `<yes/no/on/off>`: Delete disabled commands when used by non-admins.
× /disabled: List the disabled commands in this chat.

Note:
When disabling a command, the command only gets disabled for non-admins. All admins can still use those commands.
Disabled commands are still accessible through the /connect feature. If you would be interested to see this disabled too, let me know in the support chat.

**Key Features:**
- Disable specific bot commands for non-admin users
- Admins can always bypass disabled commands
- Optional automatic deletion of disabled command messages
- Support for disabling multiple commands at once

**Disable Multiple Commands:**
`/disable adminlist rules info`
Disables `/adminlist`, `/rules`, and `/info` commands at once.

**Toggle Command Deletion:**
`/disabledel on` - Disabled messages will now be deleted.
`/disabledel off` - Disabled messages will no longer be deleted.
`/disabledel` - Check the current deletion setting.
