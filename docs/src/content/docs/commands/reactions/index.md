## Automatic Message Watcher

The Reactions module includes a background message watcher at **handler group 8**.
When any user sends a message in the chat, the bot scans the text for configured
keywords and sets the matching emoji reaction automatically. Only the first matching
keyword is used to avoid rate limiting. The watcher runs silently and uses
`ext.ContinueGroups` so it never blocks other handlers.

## Inline Help Callbacks

The help menu for Reactions includes inline keyboard buttons that show detailed
usage for each command using `reactions_help` prefixed callback data:

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| "Add Reaction" | Shows `/addreaction` usage via `reactions_help.add` |
